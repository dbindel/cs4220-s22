# Project idea
## Due March 7

*Only for those of you taking this course as 5223!*

The goal of this project is to find a paper that describes a numerical
algorithm, implement it in Julia, do something to test your
implementation, and write a short discussion.  For this deadline,
I just want a couple sentences about things that you might like to
explore.

If you have a paper in mind already, that's great!  If not, that is
also fine.  It is fine to also propose something that is well
documented in textbooks, which is surely the case for some classic
papers.  If you do this, you should try to find one of the original
papers, and maybe comment on the presentation differences between the
original paper and the modern textbook version.  It is also fine to
implement and comment on one algorithm in a paper that discusses
several methods.

For those of you who are working on research projects, I'm happy to
work with you to find something relevant to your research.

Some places to look for ideas:

- [ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software](https://dl-acm-org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/journal/toms)
- [SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing](https://epubs-siam-org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/journal/sjoce3)
- [SIAM Journal of Matrix Analysis and Applications](https://epubs-siam-org.proxy.library.cornell.edu/journal/sjmael)

All of these are available via the university library system, and the
links above all use the library proxy.
You might also enjoy looking through this list of
